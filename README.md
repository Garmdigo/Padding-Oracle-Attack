# Padding Oracle Attack
 How to run:
      type python connect.py
 
The script properly runs the padding oracle attack. 
It works with fragmentary/nonfragmentary data.
This attack is requesting information from the server and using it to find the secret message. 

Future iterations:
 If the server outputs a file, an import data function will be needed.
